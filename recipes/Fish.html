    <p>How to Make Beer-Battered Fish
        You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
        
        Beer Batter for Fish
        To make the beer batter for fish, you’ll need the following ingredients: salt and pepper, flour, garlic powder, paprika, an egg, and (of course!) a can or bottle of beer. 
        
        Best Fish for Frying
        The best fish for frying is white, neutral-flavored, and lean. This recipe calls for cod, which is mild and has a sturdy texture that stands up well to the hot oil. 
        
        Best Beer for Beer Batter
        You can use any beer you have on hand. The yeast in the beer acts like yeast in bread, making the batter thin and puffy. 
        
        Just make sure your beer is extra cold — when the cold batter hits the hot oil, the reaction ensures the coating is nice and crispy when it comes out of the fryer. </p>
